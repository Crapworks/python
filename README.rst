Python Snippets
===============

Some random snippets in python. Currently:

- socket_server.py: create a socket and handle a number of parallel connections in seperate threads
- sys_monitor.py: get system health information from /proc and make them usable
- thread_pool.py: implement a thread pool class and distribute work units to them
